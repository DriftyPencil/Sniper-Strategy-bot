# Sniper Strategy Bot

Python implementation of a first-pass sniper-style forex spread betting bot for IG.

It is designed to start safely:

- `DEMO` environment by default
- `DRY_RUN=true` by default
- explicit spread filter before entries
- one open position per market direction check
- ATR-based stop and target distances

## Why Python

IG exposes REST and streaming APIs over HTTP/JSON. Python is the most practical first language for this bot because it has strong HTTP tooling, data analysis libraries when we add backtesting, and simple deployment paths for scheduled workers.

## Setup

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your IG demo API key, username, password, account id if needed, and the forex EPICs you want to trade.

## Run once

```bash
set -a
source .env
set +a
sniper-bot --once
```

## Run continuously

```bash
set -a
source .env
set +a
sniper-bot
```

## Backtest CSV Data

Download 5-minute candles from IG first:

```bash
sniper-download-prices CS.D.EURUSD.MINI.IP --resolution MINUTE_5 --points 1000 --out data/eurusd_5m.csv
```

Then backtest the CSV:

```bash
set -a
source .env
set +a
sniper-backtest data/EURUSD_5m.csv --spread 0.0001 --trades-out backtest-results/eurusd_trades.csv
```

The CSV needs `timestamp`, `open`, `high`, `low`, and `close` columns. `volume` and `spread` are optional.

The backtester uses the same indicator entry logic as the live bot:

- enter on the signal candle close after EMA 9/21 crosses
- calculate SL as ATR(14) * `STOP_ATR_MULTIPLE`
- calculate TP1-TP5 as 1R through 5R
- exit on the configured attached target via `BROKER_TARGET_INDEX`, or on SL
- if SL and TP are both touched in one candle, count SL first for conservative results

## Strategy

The first version is intentionally conservative and configurable:

- fresh signal candles are detected from EMA 9/21 crossovers
- retests are tracked when price pulls back into the EMA 9/21 ribbon after a signal
- a 7-factor bull/bear dashboard scores VWAP, RSI, MACD, EMA trend, ADX, volume candle direction, and 5m RSI
- ATR(14) * `STOP_ATR_MULTIPLE` defines the stop and five R-multiple take-profit distances
- the broker order attaches one configurable TP level via `BROKER_TARGET_INDEX`
- current spread must be below `MAX_SPREAD_POINTS`

`SCORE_THRESHOLD` defaults to `0`, matching the Pine script where score is dashboard context and EMA cross is the trade trigger. Raise it if you want automation to require stronger confluence than the chart indicator itself requires.

This is a foundation, not financial advice. Validate in IG demo, add backtests, and review every EPIC's margin, minimum size, expiry, and dealing rules before risking capital.
